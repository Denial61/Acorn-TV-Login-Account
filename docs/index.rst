Logging in allows you to resume shows, browse your watchlist, and ensure you're streaming through a secure, personalized portal.

How Do I Log Into My Acorn TV Account?
Logging into your account is simple and takes just a moment. Begin by opening your browser and visiting the official Acorn TV website. Once there, click the “Sign In” button usually located at the top right corner of the homepage.

Enter the email address you used to sign up, followed by your password. If the details are correct, you’ll be directed to your account dashboard where you can resume watching or explore new titles.

For mobile users or smart TV apps, the process is similar. Launch the Acorn TV app, select the login option, and input your credentials. You’ll instantly gain access to your profile and all saved content.

What If I Forgot My Password?
Forgetting your password happens to the best of us. If you’re unable to log in, simply click on the “Forgot Password?” link on the login page. You’ll be asked to enter your email address, and Acorn TV will send you a link to reset your password. Follow the steps in your email to choose a new password and regain access to your account.

Always make sure to check your spam or promotions folder if you don’t see the email right away.

Can I Access My Acorn TV Login Account on Multiple Devices?
Yes, Acorn TV supports multiple devices under a single account. Once you’ve logged in, you can stream content from smartphones, tablets, smart TVs, and even desktop browsers. Just use the same email and password across all platforms.

However, the number of devices you can stream on simultaneously may be limited depending on the current Acorn TV policy, so be sure to log out of devices you're not actively using to avoid interruptions.

Check your subscription status and renewal dates

These features make it convenient to keep track of your viewing habits and budget, all from one place.

Is Acorn TV Free with a Login Account?
No, creating an Acorn TV login account does not automatically give you free access. However, new users often get a free trial period. Once the trial ends, you’ll need an active subscription to continue streaming.

Even if you don’t subscribe right away, you can still keep your login credentials saved for future use or when you’re ready to return.
